description: Spatial awareness is often intentional, arising from deliberate actions
  towards a target, while at other times it emerges from unexpected motion in the
  scene. To navigate the environment, animals must differentiate the spatial cues
  generated by self-motion from object movements that originate externally. To reveal
  the neural basis of this ability, we examined the midbrain superior colliculus (SC),
  which contains multiple egocentric maps of sensorimotor space. By simulating whisker-guided
  navigation through a dynamic landscape, we discovered a transient neural response
  that selectively emerged for unexpected, externally generated tactile motion. This
  transient response only emerged when external motion either gained or lost contact
  with a whisker, arguing that sensorimotor expectations are specific to a somatotopic
  location. When external motion sustained contact with the same whiskers, neurons
  shifted their spike timing to follow the dynamics of self-generated tactile features.
  Thus, representations based on the timing of self-generated cues may surpass the
  spatial acuity of the whisker array. In conclusion, the SC contains complementary
  rate and temporal codes to differentiate external from self-generated tactile features.
